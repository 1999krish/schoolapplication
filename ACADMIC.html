                  <p class="card-text">Swamiji was born on the 19th September 1932, on the day of Ashweeja Krishna Chaturthi, in the city of Agra. His father, Shiva Shanker Pande who was a teacher, and his mother Triveni Devi both came from devout Brahmin families and they named him Ambika Prasad.

                    During his early years Ambika Prasad spent most of his time with his doting maternal grandparents, where he became absorbed in Satsang and Prayers. Around this time a sage who was visiting the house saw this charming boy and predicted that he was destined to perform a great service to humanity.
